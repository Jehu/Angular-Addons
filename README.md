This are some angular widgets, filters and directrives i use in my projects.

## widget.chosen.js
[chosen](https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/) is a great enhancement for the good old select html element. This widget is a wrapper for it.

## filter.i18n.js
Based on a simple approach to translate strings in an javascript application, this filter gives you all you need.
